## Planned improvements

*  RTM client should be an eventemitter that emits a well-defined set of lifecycle events.
   How does this interact with emitting slack events?

*  Web client should also be an eventemitter but it only emits lifecycle events. These events should
   allow developers to hook more deeply into the client and modify the requests as well as process
   the response.
